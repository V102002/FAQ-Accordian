- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS

 1.Write down the HTML
 2. Style with CSS
 3. Work out the logic of javascript and START coding!
keeping this in mind, I will continue solving JS challenges

### Continued development

I must focus more on JS and tackle more challenges to ge more better writing JavaScript.
